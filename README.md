This the secnod project of the course Research_Track_2, the project aimed to run the robot within the above given circuit with the following abalities

* Constantly driving around the environment in the clockwise direction when the user start.
* Avoiding to hit the walls.
* Being able to increase or decrease the velocity if the user wants 
* And Resetting its initial position when the user wants.

The package contains the C++ sources needed for the interaction with the robot & the user.

## Install and Running 

The simulator requires ROS ( Robot Operating System ),Once you have installed ROS and created your workspace you have to download the package second_assignment in the src folder of your workspace.en run the launch file that:roslaunch second_assignment second_assignment.launch the launch file will run the multiple node and same time for the user to make the thnig easer.













The environment is a simple 3D model of the actual Monza's F1 circuit. ROS (Robot Operating System) is a set of tools and libraries for autonomous, robust, efficient, and secure mobile robot navigation, which uses sensors to sense the environment and computer vision techniques as the navigation method.
